“Python was released in 1991 for the first time. Python 2 was
released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list
comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection system
(in addition to reference counting). Python 3 was released in 2008
and was a major revision of the language that is not
completely backward-compatible.”
